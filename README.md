# The ceelows method

The ceelows method is a framework or guideline that can be applied to any character in SFV as a tool for learning the game and ranking up.

As you progress through the ranks, you will be adding tools to develop a gameplan with your character.

By keeping the amount of tools used in the beginning low, you can focus on learning the flow of the game, rather than trying to memorise
a lot of buttons, combos and tools upfront.

As you rank up, each rank should build on the previous rank - so when following this guide, make sure to keep using the previous ranks tools too, unless 
explicitly replaced by a better option.

This guide is an outline, not the complete package. You'll need to research what certain terms and techniques are outside of this guide, but you can use this as a jumping off point.

## Rookie -> Bronze: Poking and blocking

- Use 1 or 2 moves in neutral to poke and control space.
	- If you land the hit with your poke, you are quite safe to press the poke again
	- If your opponent blocks the poke, its usually a good idea to wait a little bit more pressing it again - don't mash!
	- After an opponent blocks or gets hit by your poke, be on the look out for a jump!
	  Opponents will get frustrated and try to get away and often this will result in a jump.
	  Walking back when you feel like your opponent might jump is a good way to give you enough space to anti air.

- Use the best button to anti air jump ins and focus on anti airing every jump in your opponent attempts.
	- As you poke your opponent, they will want to get away from your pokes, and usually lower ranked players tend to jump to get out and try to land an attack.
	  This is why anti airing is so important!
	- After you anti air, block, opponents like to ex dp after they get anti aired and can win you a punish.

- When you get knocked down, backroll every time
	- You can do this by pressing either the back direction or any two kicks as you hit the ground.
	- Focus on doing this successfully every time you get knocked down.

- After you backroll, block.
	- Pressing buttons (like using an ex DP) can come later on, for now, learn to be comfortable blocking.
	- Your opponent cant hit you if you block!
	- Usually after blocking a few moves, you will have enough space to comfortable walk back and start poking again.

- If you have found yourself in the corner from walking back, block and use v reversal to gain space.
	- Each character has a different v reversal, make sure to practice what your characters v reversal input is and what it can do.
	- After v reversaling you might already be out of the corner, or you might have enough space to poke again, this also might be a good time to jump out of the corner.

- Learn a combo to punish big unsafe moves, like ex dps.
	- After you land the combo, do not rush into the opponent and attack again, this is usually the time when opponents at lower ranks like to
	  ex dp, so calmly approach the opponent and simply block as they get back to their feet. 

- Neutral jump over fireballs
	- this will interrupt their fireball pattern and give you time and space to poke them back

- If you block a sweep, sweep back to punish.

- If you're uncomfortable, backdash.

- In general, play defensively, learn to be comfortable blocking, poke to cause damage, anti air jumps and punish ex dps! 

## Bronze -> Silver: Learning to combo and punish

- Learn a basic meterless BnB combo
	- Usually this will start from a medium button.
	- Use this to punish generally unsafe moves - things like tatsus, overheads, close range sweeps, whiffed command grabs.
	- If you have super available, end your bnb in a super for more damage.
	- You will learn what is punishable over time, use training mode!

- Learn a crush counter combo
	- When you block an ex reversal, use this crush counter combo to gain v meter and deal a lot of damage.
	- This will replace the previous combo in rookie.

- Learn a fast combo to punish slightly unsafe moves.
	- Usually starting with a 3f or 4f move.
	- These combos can be difficult to execute in a real match, consider not ending your combo in a special move if you don't have the execution yet.
	- Use this to punish moves like kens st hk and heavy tatsu, balrogs dash punch, etc.
	- You will need to learn and practice over time which moves are unsafe enough to punish like this

- If people are in your face, press a fast, safe blockstring to push the opponent away instead of your poke.

- If people constantly dash after throwing you and throw you again, mash a light button, use carefully.

- Very rarely, you might find yourself against someone who just blocks all your pokes and never gives you an opportunity to deal damage through a punish
	- In these cases, after they have blocked a few pokes of yours, you can dash in and throw.

## Silver -> Gold: Hit confirming & v triggers, the beginning of offence.

- Replace your best anti air button with a reliable air-invincible move if your character has one.

- Learn and use the "delay tech" on wake up and defending against opponent block strings and pressure.

- Start incorporating forward jumps and hit confirms into your gameplay, usually if the opponent is following an obvious pattern like throwing non stop fireballs.
	- When you jump in, you must have a plan in mind, start by learning the hit confirm
	- Jump in with the same button every time, and start your BnB combo
	- If the jump in hits, continue the BnB combo and finish with a knockdown causing move or super if you have it
	- If the jump in is blocked, stop the BnB combo or finish with a safe move if your character has one.

- Start incorporating your characters neutral options if they have one outside of their pokes.
	- Things like cody ex zonk, juri stores, ryu f hp. 

- Learn and use v trigger cancel combos, make sure to hit confirm them.
	- Start to use the utility of your v trigger outside of the activation combo if your character has one.

- Start to use dash up throw more often if your opponent is blocking too many of your pokes.

- When you get a knockdown, approach the opponent and delay tech on their wakeup.
	- You are attempting to bait an ex reversal to punish.
	- The delay tech will keep you safe if they press a button or try to throw.

## Gold -> Plat: Develop an offensive gameplan, punish optimally.

- Learn and use all your optimal punishes for all frames starting from 3f.

- Learn 1 and 2 bar extensions of optimal punishes.

- Learn corner variations of your combos and any 1 or 2 bar extentions.

- Understand what oki is and how to gain it off knockdowns
	- Learn the specific timings needed to gain oki from the common knockdowns for your character and how they apply when an opponent quick rises or back rises
	- Usually involves a dash or two, most will need some form of manual timing to deal with variations in opponents quick rise or back rise decisions.

- Start to develop and use an offensive gameplan to apply pressure on your opponent when you gain oki.
	- Learn about meaties and how to hit confirm
	- Learn about frame traps and confirming them, mixing in throws to keep an opponent guessing
	- Learn about tick throws
	- Start to develop a simple gameplan to apply when an opponent is knocked down and you have oki using the previous techniques.
	- If you successfully hit the opponent, try to pick confirms that lead to another advantageous situation

- Incorporate more neutral tools your character may have:
	- For example, anti zoning tools like projectile invincible moves.

- Start to mix up your defence IF your opponent is opening you up even though you are delay teching.
	- V shift
	- fastest light
	- delay jab
	- ex dp

- It's important not to build a bad habit of becoming too predictable on defence. Blocking and delay teching are still the safest options
  and an overreliance on unsafe defensive options can keep you stuck in these ranks for a long time. In other words, save the ex dps, use them sparingly.
	
## Plat -> Diamond: The final pieces

- Further develop character specific offensive game plan
	- Watch a lot of high level matches
- Shimmy as an offensive option to beat delay tech
- Learning when not to delay tech
- Low confirms
- Single hit confirms
- Reacting to and punishing dashes
- Optimise combos, for example, ending in a more damaging special for your combo in the corner as you may not need as much knockdown adv.
- V shift as an on reaction punish
- Risk v Reward, start to take calculated risks to open up opponents
